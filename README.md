# EcoSort-RL
_Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Sorting of Battery Components_

---

## 🌍 
Efficient **battery recycling** requires not only safe dismantling but also **fast, reliable sorting** of parts such as cells, metal casings, connectors, and plastic housings.  
This project demonstrates how **reinforcement learning (RL)** can be applied to teach a robot arm to **pick and place different components into the correct bins**.  

The project is independent but closely related to dismantling/recycling applications (e.g., di.monta).  
It shows how to combine **ROS 2**, **Gazebo**, and **PyTorch RL** to solve a sustainability-driven robotics problem.
